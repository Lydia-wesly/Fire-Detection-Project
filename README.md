# Fire-Detection-Project
Real-time Fire Detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV for video-based hazard prevention.

##  Features

- Real-time fire detection from webcam/video feed  
-  Built using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once – v8)  
-  Integrated with OpenCV for video stream processing  
-  Alerts/logs potential fire hazards  
-  Lightweight and fast

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib (optional for debugging)
